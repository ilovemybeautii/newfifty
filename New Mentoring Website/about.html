    <p> Hello, I am turning 50 this year and many tell me that I don't look my age. I'm sure that there's a whole lot of you girls and guys out there getting the same response when it comes to not looking your age too.<strong>LET YOUR AGE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIFE OF A YOUTH.</strong> </p>

    <p>Being a Grand Mother of two, Wife of a Celebrity DJ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/farleyjackmasterfunk"> (Farley Jackmaster Funk, the King of House Music)</a>, Mother of three, and founder of <a href="https://kidskorna.com/">Kidz Korna</a>, a youth organization for the safety and protection of young people, I've been too busy to realize that I am about to enter a age group that is suppose to a milestone and something very special.</p>

	<p>So I decided to investigate my purpose in the matter. Some would consider it a blessing for today’s crave of wanting to look young, but the burden now comes with where do I fit in. According to a study, the definition of the word middle age, can be considered to be between 27 between and 75.  The theory is based on an age range not a number because there are different varieties of looking at one’s lifestyle and activities to be considered what's acceptable for a particular age. </p>

	<p>But, what definitely separates the issue is the fact that young people have potential, they live life based on thinking that they can do everything. Older people most likely pursue those things that matters because being old has limitations. Middle age is a point in life when you shift from seeing the future in terms of your potential and begin to see it in terms of your limitations.</p>

	<p>A major milestone is turning 50 and I celebrate everything that comes with it, but I still know that there’s a deeper purpose for this journey other than looks being measured as a yard stick to age.  Another burden to this issue is how we feel about <em>young adults not giving us the same gratitude &amps; appreciation as we did our parents and grandparents.</em> Do they see you as being just a few steps away from their age group, treating us like a girlfriend with much <strong>ATTITUDE!</strong> </p>

	<p>Oh, that’s right they consider that role as being too controlling now that they have become adults and think they know everything with a touch of the computer.  Finally, I get it! as I see my daughter gain a greater appreciation for my many sacrifices of raising her, now that she’s facing the same challenges of being in the parenting role. That experience doesn’t come from the computer.  <em><strong>It only comes from living life, life’s experiences happening to all of us.</strong> </em>  As my grandparents would often say, <em><strong>“there’s nothing new under the sun,”</strong></em> and trust me I glean from the wisdom of my elders.</p>

 	<p>But, the younger generation would like to think that they are a new generation because they are the first to live in this technology world.  So, now we have got to be the new 50!  Applying wisdom of seniors and elders to the technical appetites of today’s youth. Since, youth have mastered something that many elders run from, there is a <strong>digital divide and a communication breakdown between young people and elders.</strong>  So, how as we are in between fix this because, to not share knowledge, talents and many legacies of our grandparents to our grandchildren is a huge problem. </p>

	<p>This year marks 20 years of me having founded <em>Kidz Korna, NFP a non-profit grass root program for at-risk youth</em>, and boy do they need to see us teach and model a certain lifestyle before them if they are going listen to us.  This new 50 campaign is what it’s all about. A 50 plus generation whose living healthier while inspiring youth to engage in healthier lifestyle choices and we mediate better solutions for our young people through the wisdom of elders.  Because, going viral is not the answer to passing the torch down to the next generation.  If you are with me join me:  <strong><a href="contact.html">BECOME A NEW MENTOR TODAY!</a></strong></p>
